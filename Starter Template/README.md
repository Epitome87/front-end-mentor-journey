# Starter Template

This folder merely stores various templates which I will most likely reuse across multiple Frontend Mentor Challenges. It includes:

1. README-template.md: The markup that will be used to present each challenge to a GitHub page. This includes information such as the project name, tools used, challenges faced, what I learned during the completion of the challenge, etc.
2. SCSS-template.scss: The starter SCSS file for each challenge. This includes basic global resets (no margins, no padding, border-box on all elements) and mixins for media queries. It also includes styling of the Frontend Mentor attribution footer, where I announce that this webpage is a Challenge by Frontend Mentor coded by Matthew McGrath.
